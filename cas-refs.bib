  abstract = {The third edition of this highly acclaimed undergraduate textbook is suitable for teaching all the mathematics for an undergraduate course in any of the physical sciences. As well as lucid descriptions of all the topics and many worked examples, it contains over 800 exercises. New stand-alone chapters give a systematic account of the 'special functions' of physical science, cover an extended range of practical applications of complex variables, and give an introduction to quantum operators. Further tabulations, of relevance in statistics and numerical integration, have been added. In this edition, half of the exercises are provided with hints and answers and, in a separate manual available to both students and their teachers, complete worked solutions. The remaining exercises have no hints, answers or worked solutions and can be used for unaided homework; full solutions are available to instructors on a password-protected web site, www.cambridge.org/9780521679718.},

abstract = {Displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) was developed for high-resolution myocardial displacement mapping. Pixel phase is modulated by myocardial displacement and data spatial resolution is limited only by pixel size. 2D displacement vector maps were generated for the systolic action in canines with 0.94 × 1.9 mm nominal in-plane resolution and 2.3 mm/π displacement encoding. A radial strain of 0.208 was measured across the free left ventricular wall over 105 ms during systole. DENSE displacement maps require small first-order gradient moments for encoding. DENSE magnitude images exhibit black-blood contrast which allows for better myocardial definition and reduced motion-related artifacts.}

abstract = {The increasing availability of full-field displacement data from imaging techniques in experimental mechanics is determining a gradual shift in the paradigm of material model calibration and discovery, from using several simple-geometry tests towards a few, or even one single test with complicated geometry. The feasibility of such a “one-shot” calibration or discovery heavily relies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability to probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the stresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient for an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of the displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In this paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to optimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an anisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic, high-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of the inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy displacement measurements from digital image correlation. We discuss the choice of the cost function and the design of the topology optimisation framework, and we analyse a range of optimised topologies generated for the identification of isotropic and anisotropic elastic responses.}

abstract = {Abstract With the advent of camera-based full-field measurement techniques such as digital image correlation (DIC), researchers have been trying to exploit such rich data sets through the use of more complex test configurations than the standard ones (uniaxial tension/compression, bending etc.). This new paradigm in mechanical testing of materials has recently been christened ‘Material Testing 2.0’. This paper provides a brief overview of this field, which is currently seeing a large increase in research effort.},

abstract = {Abstract Full-field optical measurements like digital image correlation or the grid method have brought a paradigm shift in the experimental mechanics community. While inverse identification techniques like finite element model updating or the virtual fields method have been the object of significant developments, current test methods, inherited from the age of strain gauges or linear variable displacement transducers, are generally not well adapted to the rich information provided by these new measurement tools. This paper provides a review of the research dealing with the design and optimization of heterogeneous mechanical tests for the identification of material parameters from full-field measurements, christened here Material Testing 2.0 (MT2.0).},
